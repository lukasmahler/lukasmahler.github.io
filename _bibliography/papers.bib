  title={Lifestyle Behaviors and Wealth-Health Gaps in Germany},
  author={Mahler, Lukas and Yum, Minchul},
  abstract={We document significant gaps in wealth across health status over the life cycle in Germany—a country with a universal healthcare system and negligible out-of-pocket medical expenses. To investigate the underlying sources of the empirical patterns in wealth-health gaps, we build a heterogeneous-agent life-cycle model in which health and wealth evolve endogenously. In the model, agents exert efforts to lead a healthy lifestyle, which helps maintain good health status in the future. Effort choices, or lifestyle behaviors, are subject to adjustment costs to capture various aspects of micro-level effort adjustment behaviors in the data. We find that our calibrated model generates around half of the wealth gaps by health observed in the German micro data, and that variations in health-related lifetime outcomes are largely explained by uncertainty realizations over the life cycle, rather than initial conditions at age 25. Our counterfactual experiments indicate that variations in individual health efforts account for over half of the model-generated wealth gaps by health status. Their importance is due not only to the fact that they affect labor income and savings rates, both of which influence wealth accumulation, but also because they act as an amplification device since richer households exert relatively more efforts to maintain a healthy lifestyle.},

  title={Efficiency and Equity of Education Tracking - A Quantitative Analysis},
  author={Bellue, Suzanne and Mahler, Lukas},
  year={2023},
  abstract={We study the long-run aggregate and distributional effects of school tracking – the allocation of students to different types of schools – by incorporating school track decisions into a general-equilibrium heterogeneous-agent overlapping-generations model. The key ingredient in the model is a child skill production technology, where a child’s skill development depends on her classroom peers and the instruction pace in her school track. We show analytically that this technology can rationalize reduced-form evidence on the effects of school tracking on the distribution of child skills. We calibrate the model to data from Germany, a country with a very early and strict school tracking policy. Our model suggests that eliminating the parental influence on the school track choice that arises purely from own-track preferences improves social mobility while keeping aggregate output constant. An education reform that postpones the tracking age from age 10 to age 14 generates even larger improvements in intergenerational mobility. However these come at the cost of efficiency losses in aggregate economic output. The size of these losses depend on the design of the instruction levels in each school track.},
