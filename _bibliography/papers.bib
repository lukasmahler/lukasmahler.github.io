  title={Lifestyle Behaviors and Wealth-Health Gaps in Germany},
  author={Mahler, Lukas and Yum, Minchul},
  abstract={We document significant gaps in wealth across health status over the life cycle in Germany---a country with a universal healthcare system and negligible out-of-pocket medical expenses. To investigate the underlying sources of these wealth-health gaps, we build a heterogeneous-agent life-cycle model in which health and wealth evolve endogenously. In the model, agents exert efforts to lead a healthy lifestyle, which helps maintain good health status in the future. Effort choices, or lifestyle behaviors, are subject to adjustment costs to capture their habitual nature in the data. We find that our estimated model generates the great majority of the empirical wealth gaps by health and quantify the role of earnings and savings channels through which health affects these gaps. We show that variations in individual health efforts account for around a quarter of the model-generated wealth gaps by health, illustrating their role as an amplification mechanism behind the gaps.},

  title={Efficiency and Equity of Education Tracking - A Quantitative Analysis},
  author={Bellue, Suzanne and Mahler, Lukas},
  abstract={We study the long-run aggregate and distributional effects of school tracking —the
allocation of students to different types of schools— by incorporating school track decisions
into a general-equilibrium heterogeneous-agent overlapping-generations model.
The key ingredient in the model is the child skill production technology, where a child’s
skill development depends on her classroom peers and the instruction pace in her school
track. We show analytically that this technology can rationalize reduced-form evidence
on the effects of school tracking on the distribution of child skills. We calibrate the
model using representative data from Germany, a country with a very early and strict
school tracking policy. Our model suggests that eliminating the parental influence on
the school track choice that arises purely from own-track preferences improves both social
mobility and aggregate economic output. An education reform that postpones the
tracking age from ten to fourteen generates similar improvements in intergenerational
mobility. However, these come at the cost of modest efficiency losses in aggregate economic
output. The size of these losses depends on the design of the instruction levels
in each school track and on the presence of general equilibrium effects in the labor
market.},
