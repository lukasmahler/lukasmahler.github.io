Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. student in economics at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/en). My research interests are in Macroeconomics, Inequality and Social Mobility, with a special focus on Education and Health.

I am on the 2023-24 economics job market and will be available for interviews.

In my job market paper (download [here](https://lukasmahler.github.io/assets/pdf/Mahler_JMP.pdf)), we build a general-equilibrium model of human capital formation within and across generations to study the long-term aggregate and distributional effects of a common feature of education policy in many countries:
School tracking---the separtion of students into different types of schools. 
We find that in the case of Germany, a country that tracks school children already at age 10, a postponement of the tracking age presents a trade-off between social mobility gains on the one hand, and efficiency losses in aggregate human capital and output on the other hand.
