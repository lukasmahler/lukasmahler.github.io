Welcome to my website! I am an Assistant Professor in the Economics Department at [KU Leuven](https://feb.kuleuven.be/research/economics).
I am also affiliated with the [RFBerlin](https://www.rfberlin.com/).
I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from the [University of Mannheim](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/en).

My research interests are in Macroeconomics, Labor, Public, and Family Economics. 

Check out a recent episode of the Brookings [Podcast](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/are-fertility-rates-falling-because-of-social-comparisons/) on Economic Activity, where we talked about our recent [BPEA paper](https://lukasmahler.github.io/assets/pdf/5_Mahler_Tertilt_Yum_unembargoed.pdf) on Policy Concerns in an Era of Low Fertility. 

You can download my CV [here](https://lukasmahler.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_Mahler.pdf).
