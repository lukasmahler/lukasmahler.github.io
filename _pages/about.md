Welcome to my website! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the economics department at [KU Leuven](https://feb.kuleuven.be/research/economics/ces), which I will join as an Assistant Professor in 2025.
I hold a Ph.D. in economics from the [University of Mannheim](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/en).

My research interests are in Macroeconomics, Labor Economics, and Public Economics, with a special focus on Inequality and Social Mobility.
