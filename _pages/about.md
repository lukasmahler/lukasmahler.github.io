Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. student in economics at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/en). I will join the economics department at
[KU Leuven](https://feb.kuleuven.be/research/economics/ces) as a Postdoctoral Fellow later this year and as an Assistant Professor in 2025.

My research interests are in Macroeconomics, Labor Economics, and Public Economics, with a special focus on Inequality and Social Mobility.
